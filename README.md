# Joint Entity and Relation Extraction with Sequential and Tree-structured LSTMs.
A TensorFlow implementation of the paper _End-to-End Relation Extraction using LSTMs on Sequences and Tree Structures_ (https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P16-1105). 

I used the _Annotated Corpus for Named Entity Recognition_ (https://www.kaggle.com/abhinavwalia95/entity-annotated-corpus) to (pre)train the
Sequence (entity detection) part of the model.

Still a (very early) work-in-progress.
